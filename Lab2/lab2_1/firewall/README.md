Make sure to put the folder in the HOME location in the VM drive

The experiment can be run from the command line:
$ cd ./lab_2_1/firewall
$ sudo ./run.sh

Assuming that you attempt to run this in the same VM as per the lab instructions, the run.sh file:
- copies the firewall.py to the correct pox directory location
- starts the firewall controller
- runs the default experiment (block 4 hosts)
- runs other experiements for differing numbers of hosts blocked

You can then copy the terminal output into a text file and search for the keyword "Results" and find the results of all the experiments.
